//Add together two numbers.
console.log(2+2)

//Subtract two numbers.
console.log(20-15)

//Multiply two numbers.
console.log(4*5)

//Divide two numbers.
console.log(10/5)

//Find the remainder of 223 divided by 3.

console.log(223%3)

//Store the value in a variable produced by dividing 300 by 100. Declare that value with the let keyword.

let x = 300/100
console.log(x)

//Increment that variable by 1 using the increment operator.

let a = 3;
let b = ++a;
console.log('b',b)


//console.log that variable, or type it directly in the console to view it's value.
console.log(b)

//Use a multiply assignment operator to change the value of the variable to the product of multiplying it by 5.

let y = 5
y *=5

//console.log that variable, or type it directly in the console to view it's value

console.log(y)




// Declare a variable and assign it to a numeric value
//let x = "7"

// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable
x= x*2
//or x* = 2


// Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(x)

// Create two numbers, assign them to variables and add them together
//const a = 5
//const b = 20

// Check it worked by logging to the console \
console.log(a + b)

// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract the smaller two from the largest
const o = 7 
const t = 8 
const d = 25
let e = 25 - ( 8 + 7)

// Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(d - t + o)

// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other
const j = 24 
const v = 12 

// // Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(j/v)

// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply them together
const bo = 13 
const po = 3
const pop = bo * po

// Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(pop)

// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console 
const pr = 25
console.log(pr % 3)

// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?
// //helps figure out if a number is even or odd such as 3%2 (which has a remainder)
